# Cricket-Game
 It is a python GUI game where you create a virtual team of real cricket players and score points depending on how your chosen players perform in real life matches. You can also create a new team of your own and you can also select the players from the list of players according to their specializations.  Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the Centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
